# PlantDiseaseDetection
This project's goal is to create a classification model to detect and classify plant diseases using images of plant leaves. The dataset used for this is a plant disease detection dataset acquired from Kaggle which contains over 80 thousand images of various fruit and vegetable plant leaves. This is a newer dataset only created within the last year so limited usage and trial has been done with this. There will also be 3 different models constructed within this project. The first model will be a K neighborsâ€™ classifier which will be used as the baseline model to compare the other two models with. The second model will be a multi-layer CNN (convolutional neural network) using TensorFlow. The third and final model will also be a CNN that is constructed with transfer learning which builds off pre-trained models such as EfficientNet or ResNet50. 

Code for the data exploration of the dataset is also included in this repository. The data exploration looks at the differenet classes, the number of images in each class, shape of each class, which features were removed, and what the images themselves look like. Link to the dataset can be found below. All code was created on Jupyter Notebook using python. The files uploaded here will be .ipynb files.
